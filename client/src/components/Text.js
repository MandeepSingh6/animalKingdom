          Here at Animal Kingdom Park, we provide jungle like environment to our
          animals and do not put them in cages just to make money, here they
          roam around in complete freedoom in their teritories. In our parm only
          those animals are present which cannot survive on their own in wild or
          if they require some preservation measures for survival of their race.
